# kel

This is the source code of my FOSS Discord bot called kel, made using 
Python and Discord.py. To work, it requires a file called 
.env, which holds things like a Discord Application Token, 
required for the application to communicate with the Discord API.

This bot also creates at least 2 log files, 1 for general bot messages
and 1 for each server the bot is connected to, with member leaves/joins
and anything that will be implemented in the future, like message
deletions and edits
